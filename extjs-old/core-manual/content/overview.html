<h1>Ext Core Overview</h1>

<div id="intro" class="sect">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Ext Core is a lightweight and feature rich core JavaScript library available under an MIT license. Ext Core is packed full of exciting features intended to allow for rapid web development while encouraging well designed and scalable code. This library provides abstractions for DOM manipulation/traversal, Ajax, Events and custom events, animations, templating, OO mechanisms and more. Ext Core is released under an MIT license and is perfect for inclusion in a dynamic webpage or even a small application.

	<h2>Including Ext Core</h2>
	<p>Ext Core ships with both a debug version as well as a production version.  The production version has been minified (whitespace, carriage returns and comments removed) and obfuscated (all local variables have been renamed to shorter versions) using YUI Compressor.  You should always use the -debug version when developing since you'll receive more informative (ie: unobfuscated) error messages.
	</p>

	<p>
	To include the Ext Core library's development version, simply include the following JavaScript file:
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;script src=<span class="string">"ext-core-debug.js"</span>&gt&lt/script&gt</pre>

	<p>
	And for the production version (25k compressed and gzipped), simply remove "-debug":
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;script src=<span class="string">"ext-core.js"</span>&gt&lt/script&gt</pre>	

	<p>
	That's it.  There is no css file to include with Ext Core.
